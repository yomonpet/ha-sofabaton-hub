## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- Home Assistant development environment
- MQTT broker (Mosquitto recommended)
- Sofabaton Hub device (for testing)

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ha-sofabaton-hub.git
cd ha-sofabaton-hub
```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install dependencies**:
```bash
pip install homeassistant
```

4. **Link to Home Assistant**:
```bash
# Create symlink to your HA config directory
ln -s $(pwd)/custom_components/sofabaton_hub ~/.homeassistant/custom_components/sofabaton_hub
```

5. **Enable debug logging** in `configuration.yaml`:
```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.sofabaton_hub: debug
```

6. **Restart Home Assistant**

## üìù Coding Guidelines

### Python Code Style

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
- Use [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) for code formatting
- Use type hints where possible
- Write docstrings for all functions and classes
- Keep functions small and focused

### Example:

```python
async def async_example_function(
    hass: HomeAssistant,
    entity_id: str,
) -> dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Example function with proper typing and docstring.
    
    Args:
        hass: Home Assistant instance
        entity_id: Entity ID to process
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary with processed data
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If entity_id is invalid
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

### JavaScript Code Style

- Use ES6+ features
- Use `const` and `let`, avoid `var`
- Use arrow functions where appropriate
- Add comments for complex logic
- Follow Lit element best practices

### Commit Messages

- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Start with a verb in present tense (Add, Fix, Update, etc.)
- Reference issue numbers when applicable

Examples:
```
Add support for custom key layouts
Fix WebSocket connection timeout issue
Update documentation for MQTT configuration
Refactor coordinator data handling (#123)
```

## üß™ Testing

### Manual Testing

Before submitting a PR, test:

1. **Fresh installation** - Remove and reinstall the integration
2. **Configuration flow** - Test both auto-discovery and manual setup
3. **All features** - Test activity switching, key control, etc.
4. **Error handling** - Test with MQTT offline, hub offline, etc.
5. **Frontend** - Test both cards in different browsers
6. **Upgrade path** - Test upgrading from previous version

### Debug Logging

Enable debug logging to help identify issues:

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.sofabaton_hub: debug
```

Check logs in: **Settings** ‚Üí **System** ‚Üí **Logs**
