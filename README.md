#### Component Details

##### 1. **Discovery (config_flow.py)**

- **mDNS/Zeroconf Discovery**: Listens for `_sofabaton_hub._udp.local.` service announcements
- **Automatic Configuration**: Extracts MAC address and MQTT broker information from mDNS TXT records
- **Manual Setup**: Allows users to manually enter connection details if discovery fails

##### 2. **Coordinator (coordinator.py)**

The coordinator is the central data management component:

- **MQTT Connection**: Connects to the MQTT broker and subscribes to relevant topics
- **Data Caching**: Maintains a local cache of activities, devices, and keys
- **Sequential Requests**: Implements a request queue to avoid overwhelming the hub
- **Debouncing**: Batches multiple updates within 500ms to reduce UI updates
- **State Management**: Tracks current activity and key data

**Key Features:**
- No periodic polling (MQTT push-based)
- Automatic reconnection on MQTT disconnection
- Request timeout handling (30 seconds)
- Duplicate message filtering

##### 3. **Remote Entity (remote.py)**

Implements the Home Assistant `remote` platform:

- **Entity State**: Reflects the current activity state (on/off)
- **Attributes**: Exposes activities, devices, keys, and current activity ID
- **Services**: Supports `turn_on`, `turn_off`, `send_command` services
- **Custom Commands**: Supports special commands like `request_basic_data`, `request_activity_keys`

##### 4. **Frontend Cards**

**Main Card (main-card.js):**
- Displays all activities as toggleable switches
- Shows current activity status
- Refresh button to reload data
- Opens detail card when clicking "More Info" on active activity

**Detail Card (detail-card.js):**
- Shows all keys for the selected activity
- Organized into tabs: Assigned Keys, Macro Keys, Favorite Keys
- Click keys to send commands
- Real-time loading states
- Periodic state check (every 5 seconds) when requesting data

5. Coordinator starts sequential request:
   - Request assigned keys
   - Wait for response
   - Request macro keys
   - Wait for response
   - Request favorite keys
   - Wait for response
   ↓
6. Hub responds to each request via MQTT
   ↓
7. Coordinator receives responses and updates state
   ↓
8. Detail Card receives state updates and displays keys
   ↓
9. Periodic check (every 5 seconds) ensures data is loaded
```

##### Key Press Flow

```
1. User clicks a key in Detail Card
   ↓
2. Frontend calls remote.send_command with key ID
   ↓
3. Remote entity publishes MQTT message to key control topic
   ↓
4. Sofabaton Hub receives command and sends IR/RF signal
   ↓

```

#### MQTT Topics

The integration uses the following MQTT topic structure (where `{mac}` is the hub's MAC address):

**Activities:**
- `activity/{mac}/list_request` - Request activity list
- `activity/{mac}/list` - Activity list response
- `activity/{mac}/activity_control_up` - Switch activity (publish)
- `activity/{mac}/activity_control_down` - Activity state change (subscribe)

**Keys:**
- `activity/{mac}/keys_request` - Request assigned keys
- `activity/{mac}/keys_list` - Assigned keys response
- `activity/{mac}/macro_keys_request` - Request macro keys
- `activity/{mac}/macro_keys_list` - Macro keys response
- `activity/{mac}/favorites_keys_request` - Request favorite keys
- `activity/{mac}/favorites_keys_list` - Favorite keys response

**Control:**
- `activity/{mac}/keys_control` - Send assigned key command
- `activity/{mac}/macro_keys_control` - Send macro key command
- `activity/{mac}/favorites_keys_control` - Send favorite key command

**Devices:**
- `device/{mac}/list_request` - Request device list
- `device/{mac}/list` - Device list response

### 🐛 Troubleshooting

#### Integration not discovered

1. Check that your Sofabaton Hub is on the same network
2. Verify mDNS/Zeroconf is enabled in Home Assistant
3. Try manual configuration instead

#### MQTT connection issues

1. Verify MQTT broker is running and accessible
2. Check MQTT credentials are correct
3. Check Home Assistant logs for connection errors

#### Keys not loading

1. Make sure the activity is active (turned on)
2. Check MQTT broker logs for message delivery
3. Wait up to 5 seconds for periodic state check
4. Try clicking the refresh button in Main Card

#### Cards not showing

1. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
3. Verify card resources are loaded in Developer Tools → Info

### ❓ FAQ

**Q: Does this integration work offline?**
A: Yes, as long as your Home Assistant, MQTT broker, and Sofabaton Hub are on the same local network. No internet connection is required.

**Q: Can I control multiple Sofabaton Hubs?**
A: Yes, you can add multiple hubs by repeating the configuration process for each device.

**Q: Why are my keys not loading immediately?**
A: The integration uses sequential requests to avoid overwhelming the hub. It may take a few seconds to load all keys (assigned, macro, and favorites). The frontend checks state every 5 seconds to ensure data is loaded.

**Q: Can I use this with Home Assistant automations?**
A: Yes! You can use the `remote.turn_on`, `remote.turn_off`, and `remote.send_command` services in your automations.

**Q: How do I send a specific key command in an automation?**
A: Use the `remote.send_command` service with the key ID:
```yaml
service: remote.send_command
target:
  entity_id: remote.sofabaton_hub_aabbccddeeff
data:
  command: "174"  # Key ID
```

**Q: What's the difference between assigned keys, macro keys, and favorite keys?**
A:
- **Assigned Keys**: Regular IR/RF keys assigned to devices in the activity
- **Macro Keys**: Custom sequences of multiple key presses
- **Favorite Keys**: Quick-access keys you've marked as favorites

**Q: Why does the integration use MQTT instead of direct HTTP API?**
A: The Sofabaton Hub uses MQTT for real-time communication. This allows for instant state updates and better responsiveness compared to polling-based HTTP APIs.

```

#### Key Design Decisions

1. **No Periodic Polling**: The integration relies entirely on MQTT push notifications to reduce network traffic and improve responsiveness.

2. **Sequential Requests**: Key data requests are queued and executed sequentially to avoid overwhelming the hub with simultaneous requests.

3. **Debouncing**: Multiple MQTT messages within 500ms are batched into a single state update to reduce UI re-renders.

4. **Data Cleanup**: Old key data is cleared when requesting new activity keys to prevent memory growth and ensure frontend only sees current activity data.

5. **Periodic State Check**: Frontend checks state every 5 seconds when requesting keys to handle cases where MQTT push fails.

#### Debugging

Enable debug logging in Home Assistant's `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.sofabaton_hub: debug
```

Then check the logs in **Settings** → **System** → **Logs**.

#### 核心组件

##### 1. **发现机制 (config_flow.py)**

- **mDNS/Zeroconf 发现**：监听 `_sofabaton_hub._udp.local.` 服务广播
- **自动配置**：从 mDNS TXT 记录中提取 MAC 地址和 MQTT 代理信息
- **手动设置**：如果发现失败，允许用户手动输入连接详情

##### 2. **协调器 (coordinator.py)**

协调器是中央数据管理组件：

- **MQTT 连接**：连接到 MQTT 代理并订阅相关主题
- **数据缓存**：维护活动、设备和按键的本地缓存
- **串联请求**：实现请求队列以避免压垮 Hub
- **防抖处理**：将 500ms 内的多个更新批量处理以减少 UI 更新
- **状态管理**：跟踪当前活动和按键数据

**关键特性：**
- 无定期轮询（基于 MQTT 推送）
- MQTT 断开时自动重连
- 请求超时处理（30 秒）
- 重复消息过滤

##### 3. **遥控器实体 (remote.py)**

实现 Home Assistant `remote` 平台：

- **实体状态**：反映当前活动状态（开/关）
- **属性**：暴露活动、设备、按键和当前活动 ID
- **服务**：支持 `turn_on`、`turn_off`、`send_command` 服务
- **自定义命令**：支持特殊命令如 `request_basic_data`、`request_activity_keys`

##### 4. **前端卡片**

**主卡片 (main-card.js)：**
- 显示所有活动为可切换开关
- 显示当前活动状态
- 刷新按钮重新加载数据
- 点击活动活动的"更多信息"打开详情卡片

**详情卡片 (detail-card.js)：**
- 显示所选活动的所有按键
- 组织为选项卡：分配按键、宏按键、收藏按键
- 点击按键发送命令
- 实时加载状态
- 请求数据时定期状态检查（每 5 秒）

#### 数据流程

##### 初始设置流程

```
1. 用户添加集成（自动发现或手动）
   ↓
2. 配置流程验证并创建配置条目
   ↓
3. 集成加载 → 协调器初始化
   ↓
4. 协调器连接到 MQTT 代理
   ↓
5. 协调器订阅 MQTT 主题
   ↓
6. 协调器请求基础数据（活动 + 设备）
   ↓
7. 创建具有初始状态的遥控器实体
   ↓
8. 前端卡片加载并显示数据
```

##### 活动切换流程

```
1. 用户在主卡片中点击活动开关
   ↓
2. 前端调用 remote.turn_on 服务
   ↓
3. 遥控器实体发布 MQTT 消息到活动控制主题
   ↓
4. Sofabaton Hub 接收命令并切换活动
   ↓
5. Hub 发布活动状态变化到 MQTT
   ↓
6. 协调器接收 MQTT 消息
   ↓
7. 协调器更新状态（带 500ms 防抖）
   ↓
8. Home Assistant 推送状态更新到前端
   ↓
9. 主卡片更新 UI 以反映新状态
```

##### 按键请求流程

```
1. 用户点击活动活动的"更多信息"
   ↓
2. 详情卡片打开并请求活动按键
   ↓
3. 前端调用 remote.send_command 并传递 "request_activity_keys"
   ↓
4. 协调器清除旧按键数据
   ↓
5. 协调器启动串联请求：
   - 请求分配按键
   - 等待响应
   - 请求宏按键
   - 等待响应
   - 请求收藏按键
   - 等待响应
   ↓
6. Hub 通过 MQTT 响应每个请求
   ↓
7. 协调器接收响应并更新状态
   ↓
8. 详情卡片接收状态更新并显示按键
   ↓
9. 定期检查（每 5 秒）确保数据已加载
```

##### 按键按下流程

```
1. 用户在详情卡片中点击按键
   ↓
2. 前端调用 remote.send_command 并传递按键 ID
   ↓
3. 遥控器实体发布 MQTT 消息到按键控制主题
   ↓
4. Sofabaton Hub 接收命令并发送 IR/RF 信号
   ↓
5. UI 中显示视觉反馈（涟漪效果）
```

#### MQTT 主题

集成使用以下 MQTT 主题结构（其中 `{mac}` 是 Hub 的 MAC 地址）：

**活动：**
- `activity/{mac}/list_request` - 请求活动列表
- `activity/{mac}/list` - 活动列表响应
- `activity/{mac}/activity_control_up` - 切换活动（发布）
- `activity/{mac}/activity_control_down` - 活动状态变化（订阅）

**按键：**
- `activity/{mac}/keys_request` - 请求分配按键
- `activity/{mac}/keys_list` - 分配按键响应
- `activity/{mac}/macro_keys_request` - 请求宏按键
- `activity/{mac}/macro_keys_list` - 宏按键响应
- `activity/{mac}/favorites_keys_request` - 请求收藏按键
- `activity/{mac}/favorites_keys_list` - 收藏按键响应

**控制：**
- `activity/{mac}/keys_control` - 发送分配按键命令
- `activity/{mac}/macro_keys_control` - 发送宏按键命令
- `activity/{mac}/favorites_keys_control` - 发送收藏按键命令

**设备：**
- `device/{mac}/list_request` - 请求设备列表
- `device/{mac}/list` - 设备列表响应

#### 数据更新机制

- **后端**：不进行定时轮询，完全依赖 MQTT 推送（防抖延迟 500ms）
- **前端**：在请求按键数据时，每 5 秒检查一次状态（不触发后端拉取）
- **实时性**：MQTT 消息推送确保即时更新

### 🐛 故障排除

#### 集成未被发现

1. 检查 Sofabaton Hub 是否在同一网络
2. 验证 Home Assistant 中是否启用了 mDNS/Zeroconf
3. 尝试手动配置

#### MQTT 连接问题

1. 验证 MQTT 代理正在运行且可访问
2. 检查 MQTT 凭据是否正确
3. 检查 Home Assistant 日志中的连接错误

#### 按键未加载

1. 确保活动已激活（已打开）
2. 检查 MQTT 代理日志以查看消息传递
3. 等待最多 5 秒进行定期状态检查
4. 尝试点击主卡片中的刷新按钮

#### 卡片未显示

1. 清除浏览器缓存（Ctrl+Shift+R 或 Cmd+Shift+R）
2. 检查浏览器控制台中的 JavaScript 错误
3. 在开发者工具 → 信息中验证卡片资源是否已加载

### ❓ 常见问题

**问：此集成是否可以离线工作？**
答：可以，只要您的 Home Assistant、MQTT 代理和 Sofabaton Hub 在同一本地网络上。不需要互联网连接。

**问：我可以控制多个 Sofabaton Hub 吗？**
答：可以，您可以为每个设备重复配置过程来添加多个 Hub。

**问：为什么我的按键没有立即加载？**
答：集成使用串联请求以避免压垮 Hub。加载所有按键（分配、宏和收藏）可能需要几秒钟。前端每 5 秒检查一次状态以确保数据已加载。

**问：我可以在 Home Assistant 自动化中使用此集成吗？**
答：可以！您可以在自动化中使用 `remote.turn_on`、`remote.turn_off` 和 `remote.send_command` 服务。

**问：如何在自动化中发送特定按键命令？**
答：使用 `remote.send_command` 服务并传递按键 ID：
```yaml
service: remote.send_command
target:
  entity_id: remote.sofabaton_hub_aabbccddeeff
data:
  command: "174"  # 按键 ID
```

**问：分配按键、宏按键和收藏按键有什么区别？**
答：
- **分配按键**：分配给活动中设备的常规 IR/RF 按键
- **宏按键**：多个按键按下的自定义序列
- **收藏按键**：您标记为收藏的快速访问按键

**问：为什么集成使用 MQTT 而不是直接 HTTP API？**
答：Sofabaton Hub 使用 MQTT 进行实时通信。这允许即时状态更新和比基于轮询的 HTTP API 更好的响应性。

#### 关键设计决策

1. **无定期轮询**：集成完全依赖 MQTT 推送通知以减少网络流量并提高响应性。

2. **串联请求**：按键数据请求排队并按顺序执行，以避免同时请求压垮 Hub。

3. **防抖处理**：500ms 内的多个 MQTT 消息批量处理为单个状态更新，以减少 UI 重新渲染。

4. **数据清理**：请求新活动按键时清除旧按键数据，以防止内存增长并确保前端只看到当前活动数据。

5. **定期状态检查**：请求按键时前端每 5 秒检查一次状态，以处理 MQTT 推送失败的情况。

#### 调试

在 Home Assistant 的 `configuration.yaml` 中启用调试日志：

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.sofabaton_hub: debug
```

然后在 **设置** → **系统** → **日志** 中检查日志。
